# LSTM-based Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building and evaluating a deep learning model for sentiment analysis of movie reviews. Utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with TensorFlow/Keras, the model classifies review text as either positive or negative. The entire development, training, and prediction pipeline is encapsulated within a Google Colab notebook for easy reproducibility and leverages GPU acceleration. Additionally, the core components are structured as separate Python modules for local execution flexibility.

## Features

* **Dataset Handling:** Leverages the widely-used IMDb movie review dataset, loaded efficiently via TensorFlow/Keras.
* **Comprehensive Text Preprocessing:** Implements robust preprocessing steps including lowercasing, punctuation and number removal, tokenization, and stopword filtering using the NLTK library.
* **Bidirectional LSTM Architecture:** Employs an Embedding layer followed by Bidirectional LSTM layers and Dense layers, optimized for capturing contextual information in text for binary sentiment classification.
* **Accelerated Model Training:** Designed to utilize Google Colab's free GPU resources, significantly speeding up the model training process.
* **Thorough Model Evaluation:** Assesses the trained model's performance (loss and accuracy) on an unseen test set.
* **Intuitive Sentiment Prediction:** Provides functions to preprocess new text input and predict its sentiment (Positive/Negative) along with a probability score.
* **Reproducible Environment:** Primarily developed and demonstrated in a Google Colab notebook for easy setup and execution in the cloud.
* **Modular Codebase:** Core logic (data preprocessing, model definition, prediction) is organized into separate Python files for clarity and potential local deployment.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** Programming Language
* **TensorFlow / Keras:** Deep Learning Framework
* **NLTK:** Natural Language Toolkit for advanced text processing
* **NumPy:** Fundamental package for numerical computing
* **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis (minimal use for IMDb dataset)
* **tqdm:** For displaying progress bars during long operations
* **Google Colab:** Cloud-based Jupyter environment with free GPU/TPU access
* **Git / GitHub:** Version control and project hosting

## How to Run the Project

This project can be run directly on Google Colab or locally.

### Option 1: Running on Google Colab (Recommended for ease of setup and GPU access)

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Ayushman125/sentiment_analysis_lstm/blob/main/notebooks/sentiment_analysis_lstm.ipynb)

1.  **Click the "Open In Colab" badge above** (or navigate to the `notebooks/sentiment_analysis_lstm.ipynb` file in this repository and click "Open in Colab").
2.  **Set Runtime to GPU:**
    * Once the notebook is open in Colab, go to `Runtime` -> `Change runtime type`.
    * Under "Hardware accelerator", select `GPU`. Click `Save`.
3.  **Run All Cells:**
    * Go to `Runtime` -> `Run all`.
    * **Follow the prompts:** When the cell for mounting Google Drive runs, a link will appear. Click it, select your Google account, grant permissions, copy the authorization code, and paste it back into the input box in the Colab notebook. This allows the notebook to save your trained model and tokenizer to your Google Drive.
    * The notebook will automatically handle NLTK data downloads, text preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and sample predictions. Training progress will be displayed via progress bars for each epoch.

### Option 2: Running Locally (Requires Python, TensorFlow, and NLTK setup)

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Ayushman125/sentiment_analysis_lstm.git](https://github.com/Ayushman125/sentiment_analysis_lstm.git)
    cd sentiment_analysis_lstm
    ```
2.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Download NLTK Data:**
    ```bash
    python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords'); nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('punkt_tab')"
    ```
5.  **Run the Model Training Script:**
    ```bash
    python model_training.py
    ```
    This script will load the data, preprocess it, build and train the model, evaluate it, and save the trained model (`sentiment_lstm_model.h5`) and tokenizer (`tokenizer.pkl`) in the `sentiment_analysis/` directory.

6.  **Run Predictions (Optional):**
    You would typically integrate prediction logic into `app.py` or a dedicated script. For simple testing, you can modify `predict.py` to accept direct input.

## Model Performance

The trained LSTM model demonstrates strong performance, achieving an approximate accuracy of **~87-88%** on the IMDb test dataset. This indicates its robust capability in distinguishing between positive and negative movie reviews.

## Future Enhancements

* **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Conduct systematic tuning of model hyperparameters (e.g., embedding dimension, LSTM units, learning rate, batch size) to further improve accuracy and training efficiency.
* **Advanced Embeddings:** Experiment with pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText) or explore contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT, ELMo) for enhanced semantic understanding.
* **Model Complexity:** Investigate more sophisticated neural network architectures, such as Transformer-based models, to potentially capture longer-range dependencies in text.
* **Larger/Diverse Datasets:** Train the model on more extensive and varied sentiment datasets to improve generalization across different domains.
* **Deployment:** Develop a lightweight web application (e.g., using Streamlit, Flask, or FastAPI) to provide a user-friendly interface for real-time sentiment prediction.
